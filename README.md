Quake 2 Midterm Project (IT-266-102)
====================================

Objective: Be the player with the most enemy monster kills in the given time.

How to play: Kill the most monsters in the given time. Each monster you kill will provide you with money that can be used to upgrade your weapons. Upgraded weapons will fire additional projectiles in additional directions. Monsters will respawn quickly so use caution and tactics while moving around the map.

Upgrading weapons: To upgrade your equipped weapon, type "upgrade" in the console, or use the F key by appending "bind f "upgrade"" to your config.cfg file. If you do not have enough funds to upgrade the weapon, an error message indicating the issue, the cost of the weapon, and the amount of money you have will be displayed.
